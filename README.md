# visthapita

Database migration framework for node.js

## Installation

    $ npm install -g visthapita
or

    $ npm install visthapita

## Usage

```
Usage: visthapita [up|down|new] migrationName [options]

Options:
  --env, -e             The environment to run the migrations under.    [default: NODE_ENV]
  --migrations-dir, -m  The directory containing your SQL migration files.  [default: "./migrations/*.json"]
  --verbose, -v         Verbose mode.                                   [default: false]
  --config              Location of the database.json file.             [default: "./config/*.yaml"]

```

## Creating Migrations

    $ visthapita create add-users

This will create a file ./migrations/add-users.json.

    {
      up : <edit>,
      down : <edit>
    }

All you have to do is populate these with your SQL string and you are ready to migrate.

For example :

    {
      up: "CREATE TABLE users( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL )",
      down : "DROP TABLE users"
    }

Then just run the migration

    $ visthapita up [add-users]

IF there is a problem then rollback. Note if you don't supply a name it will rollbakc the last migration that was run.

    $ visthapita down [add-users]

## Why yet another migration tool?

K.I.S.S.
All the others seem to be far to complicated, creating an api that you have to learn. You should be able to
run the pure SQL in order to migrate. Moreover as a developer you should be aware of what is happening
at the database level. Abstracting SQL away I believe leads to programmers having no idea about the
implications of the schema they are creating. A good developer needs to be multilingual.
